# Release Notes

## Private Beta 2

We are thrilled to launch the second private beta of Timeplus cloud release. Comparing to the [Private Beta 1](private-beta-1), most of the backend and frontend changes are incremental enhancements, except the entry point is changed from [https://{tenant}.beta.timeplus.com](https://tenant.beta.timeplus.com) to [https://beta.timeplus.cloud/{tenant}](https://beta.timeplus.cloud/tenant)

We will update the beta version from time to time and list key enhancements in this page.

###  Week of 8/8

(we kicked off  Private Beta 2. New features and enhancements will be documented on Aug 15)
